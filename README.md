# Algorithms in C

## Objective

This projects aims to provide a set of string related algorithms.

> Although this project can be used as a library, it is exclusively for personal study!

## Requirements

- Knownledge of C programs
- Understanding of shared and static libs
- Understanding on how to use Git
- Understanding on how to use terminals
- Knownledge of C build tools

## Algorithms

### Hamming Distance

It is a basic algorithm that checks how many changes a string need to have based on the position of the
characters so it can be equals to another one. The algorithm requires that both stings are of equals length.

## Running

This uses GNU Make for the build process and has the following commands:

> Running make without arguments generate both static and shared libs!

- clean: Removes build dirs
- check: List info about environment
- tests: Generate and run tests
